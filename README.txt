README : WeightedMergeAlign

WeightedMergeAlign is an algorithm that, given alignments of sequences as inputs, can compute the consensus alignment with a weighted version of the MergeAlign method.

The main function to call in order to compute the consensus MSA is weightedMA. All the files given as arguments should be in the FASTA format.
An example of use is at the end of the file, with the creation of FASTA files corresponding to consensus alignments, and the creation of an xlsx file that sums up the different computed MSA scores.
